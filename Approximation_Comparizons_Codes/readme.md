# Tips for running the codes

All codes were tested with Python version 3.10.12; if you have Ubuntu installed, you can simply run them by opening a terminal in this folder and then type one of the followings commands: <br>
> __>>python time_gmr.py__ <br>
> __>>python dtw_gmr.py__ <br>
> __>>python ss_gmr.py__ <br>
> __>>python ss_dtan.py__ <br>

The trajectory used for these examples (and others more) can be found at the Panda Co-Manipulation Dataset webpage: https://github.com/AutoLabModena/Panda-Co-Manipulation-Dataset.git <br>

Please note that, in order to run the __ss_dtan.py__ example, you should first download the DTAN library at: https://github.com/BGU-CS-VIL/dtan.git <br>
